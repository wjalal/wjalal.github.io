Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Wasif Jalal, an undergraduate senior, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. As a full-stack developer and machine learning enthusiast, I’m passionate about bioinformatics, with a focus on longevity and aging research. My expertise spans programming languages like C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like ReactJS and Node.js.

I’ve worked on projects such as BusBuddy, a smart transportation solution designed to enhance commuting efficiency, and I’m currently exploring brain-age estimation and genomic age prediction models through innovative applications of machine learning. Whether it’s computer vision, biomedical image analysis, or longevity research, I’m always eager to collaborate and create impactful solutions. Let’s connect!
